  Jumpstart Pro includes branding assets that are easily replaceable with your own logo.
<% end %>

<%= h2_with_anchor "Logo" %>

<p>The Jumpstart Pro placeholder is located in <code>app/assets/images/logo.svg</code> and you can simply replace this file to use your own logo.</p>
<p>We recommend using an SVG logo for crisp rendering at any size. Logos look best at 24px tall.</p>

<p>By default, we'll render the <code>logo.svg</code> in the navbar.</p>
<%= render_svg "logo", styles: "fill-current text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 hover:text-gray-800" %>

<p>And <code>mark.svg</code> in the footer:</p>
<%= render_svg "mark", styles: "fill-current text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 hover:text-gray-800" %>

<%= h2_with_anchor "Mobile Nav" %>

<p>
  For responsive mobile navbars, you may want to hide the logo text for more space.
  Use the class of <code>.text</code> on appropriate elements in your SVG to hide the text portion of your logo.
</p>

<%= h2_with_anchor "Favicons" %>

<p>The Jumpstart Pro favicon placeholders are located in <code>public</code> and you can simply replace these files to use your own logos.</p>
<p>We recommend <%= link_to "RealFaviconGenerator", "https://realfavicongenerator.net/", target: :_blank, class: "link" %> to generate your Favicon from an SVG. Simply extract the generated images to the public folder to replace the favicon.</p>
